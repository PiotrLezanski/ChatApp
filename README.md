# ChatApp

The purpose of this project was to learn JavaScript and PHP language used in development of web and server applications. 

I wanted to dig into server communication and how they execute and handle queries from user. I was curious how to properly login/signup new user and create independent sessions for every one of them.

My app enables real time chat communication between many users. I used XAMPP to setup Apache server, which was to trigger PHP scriptss. 

Also, I created databases on the server to store info about users and their messages. 

Front end is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It communicates with backend through AJAX, which trigger PHP scripts through API call, which returns data back to AJAX, which influences the UI.
